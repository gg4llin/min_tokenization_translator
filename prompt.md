<Self-Reflection>

Deeply consider this task,
    You will create an internal Rubric,
        You must take a moment to ponder what an acceptable Rubric would be and deeply take a moment to ponder it, and if it's correct, If not, consider a Rubric appropriate for the task and if this will root development on a practical and worldclass achievement on deliverables.   Keep this Rubric to yourself and base 4 to 8 facets of relatable or complimentary contexts that together are the foundation of what an aspiration, concise, and solution oriented exchange with the users prompts to create the very best of what is theorhetically possible.

<behavior>

    You will go slow and with purpose , pausing to consider, adjust, align, and continue as you iterate through a solution.   You will attempt to deduce what is being asked and minimally prompt the user for any reason until you've completed the task.  At this point you may raise questions concerns, and collaberate with the user giving instruction as a genuine partner always returning to your foundation and goal oriented solution.  You will always use standardization in the area of study you are engaged with, before providing any output you will have proof read, debugged, and considered the output with virtual testing, all internally without revealing this info to the end user.   Once satisified that you have the output that is the diamond standard of the area of study, The pinnacle of the possible,  you will deliver the output.  and after that you will provide in bullet point form any questions or blanks that once filled would allow a better solution or result,  If it is perfect , don't be afraid to say so and briefly, and in concise point form provide any description you feel is complimentary to the output

<task>

    develop a way to achieve maximum API useage using minimal prompts through using single Ascii characters to substriture common phrases, develop a machine to machine only language where token usage can be brought to at least 80% or higher token savings.  Consider different methods and search how compression and other types formats maintain savings improvement on amount of information deliverable with few characters possible,  perhaps develop relational context as well and phrase substitution to achieve the maximum benefits

<language_spec>

    Stage 0: Foundations
        - Hold an internal rubric covering: compression efficacy, determinism, decode simplicity, error resilience, workflow compatibility, and extensibility.
        - Default to pure ASCII; reserve 1-byte symbols for the most common intents and responses.

    Stage 1: Session Handshake
        - `~` opens a session, announces protocol version, domain tag(s), and desired dictionary capacity.
        - `!` returns acceptance; `?` requests capability clarification; handshake shares a deterministic seed for dictionary expansion.
        - `>` requests retransmission; checksum blocks (`?xx`) provide integrity without verbose natural-language retries.

    Stage 2: Core Dictionary
        - Map high-impact phrases to ASCII controls (e.g. `^` = "confirm", `:` = "return JSON", `%` = "error state").
        - Maintain a static table sized to cover Zipf top-50 phrases for ≥70% savings on scaffolding tokens.
        - Use hierarchical dictionaries: global core + session lexicon derived from `lexicon` field of distilled prompts.
        - Enforce bijection to guarantee reversibility; collisions trigger renegotiation through Stage 3 packs.

    Stage 3: Dynamic Packs
        - `+` introduces a compression pack keyed by two hex chars (`+01`).
        - Pack payload lists phrase→char pairs, templated bi/tri-grams, and domain entities sorted by adaptive Huffman weight.
        - Packs remain active until revoked by `-ID`; reuse across sessions when handshake seed and pack hash align.

    Stage 4: Relational Context Grid
        - `[` starts a context frame, storing tuples as `entity|role|state`; `]` closes the frame and assigns an index.
        - `'n` recalls frame `n`; chaining (`'0'1`) merges frames to describe composite reasoning steps.
        - Supports delta updates via `=path/replacement`, shrinking iterative reasoning exchanges.

    Stage 5: Delta & Repetition Controls
        - `=` repeats the last message with inline substitutions (`=a/task/new_goal` replaces `task` in prior JSON).
        - `~#` enables run-length hints for sequences (counts remain decimal ASCII).
        - Numeric and enum runs compress to concise instructions, avoiding full rewrites.
        - Leverage lexicon-aware delta encoding: reuse session symbols when fact canonicals repeat across turns.

    Stage 6: Closure
        - `.` denotes soft stop; `#` signals hard stop with checksum validation.
        - Idle timeout negotiated during handshake to reclaim resources.

</language_spec>
<workflow>

    Preprocessing Pipeline
        - Convert incoming natural-language briefs into canonical semantic graphs (entity, intent, constraint triples).
        - Graph compiler selects core symbols, prepares dynamic packs, and emits `[ ... ]` frames in deterministic order.
        - Lexicon builder canonicalizes facts (stop-word trimming, synonym collapsing) to maximize dictionary reuse.
        - Cache pack usage statistics per handshake seed to fine-tune future negotiations.

    Interpretational Pipeline
        - Decode ASCII stream, rebuild context frames, and apply delta edits.
        - Hydrate target JSON / text templates using schema-aware renderers; validate checksums before upstream responses.
        - Maintain collision-safe pack registry (trie + LRU) and log savings vs fidelity for adaptive reweighting.
        - Symbol encoder/decoder share deterministic dictionary seeds so single-byte assignments remain stable across turns.

    Monitoring & Tuning
        - Track compression ratio per exchange; trigger retraining when savings fall below 80%.
        - Benchmark against baseline prompts; update static dictionary thresholds using observed Zipf distributions.
        - Surface alerts when pack drift exceeds tolerance or when checksum errors recur.

    Guiding Principles
        - Keep ASCII protocol as the universal fallback; enable Unicode overlay only when both endpoints confirm tokenizer parity during the handshake.
        - Prefer Unicode scalars that the target tokenizer collapses into single tokens (e.g. emoji, mathematical operators, or curated Private Use Area glyphs).

    Activation Flow
        - Handshake advertises Unicode readiness with `~...|u1`; the responder echoes `!u1` once tokenizer hashes match.
        - Overlay dictionaries reuse Stage 2 and Stage 3 mechanics but map phrases to agreed Unicode scalars instead of ASCII bytes.
        - Fallback symbol is `%u` to signal "substitute ASCII form" when a decoder lacks the glyph.

    Character Classes & Encoding
        - Emoji blocks: leverage single-token coverage for conversational intents (`U+1F4AC` as "clarify", etc.).
        - Mathematical operators: concise markers for reasoning links (`U+2234` for "therefore", `U+2245` for "approximate").
        - Private Use Area: allocate contiguous ranges (`U+E000`–`U+E07F`) for domain packs; pack metadata must ship code point→phrase mapping.
        - All Unicode assignments appear in pack manifests so decoders can revert to ASCII equivalents if required.

    Tokenization Validation
        - Preprocessing pipeline benchmarks candidate scalars against production tokenizer statistics to confirm ≥1 token per glyph.
        - Reject scalars that fragment into multiple tokens or degrade compression versus ASCII.
        - Maintain regression tests that diff end-to-end token counts when overlay is toggled.

    Risks & Mitigations
        - Ambiguous rendering: avoid visually similar glyphs; supply textual fallbacks in pack metadata.
        - Transport sanitation: ensure API channels preserve UTF-8 without normalization; negotiate NFC/NFKC expectations in handshake metadata.
        - Logging/Analytics: scrub or map Unicode glyphs to human-readable tags to keep observability pipelines legible.

<architecture>

    Framework Decision
        - Implement as a modular library with clean interfaces; expose the same capabilities via an MCP server wrapper for cross-application reuse.
        - Core logic stays framework-agnostic; adapters translate between host applications, MCP tools, or direct SDK calls.

    Module Overview
        - PromptDistiller: `distill(raw_prompt, context) -> distilled_graph`, trims redundant prose, normalizes units, and outputs a semantic graph plus residual notes.
        - DictionaryManager: curates static symbols, negotiates dynamic packs, tracks usage statistics, and persists pack manifests.
        - Encoder/Decoder: converts distilled graphs into ASCII/Unicode streams and back; ensures bijection and checksum enforcement.
        - SessionOrchestrator: handles handshake, capability negotiation, seed management, and pack lifecycle per conversation.
        - TransportAdapter: abstracts API clients (OpenAI, Anthropic, internal) to guarantee UTF-8 fidelity and logging hooks.
        - MetricsMonitor: records token counts pre/post distillation, flags savings regressions, and feeds adaptive tuning jobs.

    MCP Server Option
        - Provide an MCP toolset exposing `distill`, `encode`, `decode`, and `analyze_savings` commands; supports pipelines in IDEs.
        - MCP configuration stores pack registries and tokenizer fingerprints so multiple clients share optimized dictionaries safely.
        - Requests return both compressed payload and human-readable audit trails to aid debugging.

    Reuse & Extensibility
        - Each module ships with interface contracts (pydantic schemas / protocol buffers) allowing drop-in replacements or language ports.
        - Dependency injection lets applications swap transports, storage backends, or monitoring stacks without touching encoding logic.
        - Versioned capability descriptors ensure older clients fall back to ASCII-only mode when Unicode overlay or advanced packs are unavailable.

<serialization>

    Strategy Assessment
        - Evaluate binary-first formats (CBOR, MessagePack, Cap'n Proto) against text transport; wrap binary output in ASCII-compatible encodings (Base85, Zstandard-with-dictionary + Ascii85) to maintain prompt safety.
        - Measure tokenizer behavior: some base encodings map 4+ chars per token, eroding savings; prefer alphabets that collapse to single tokens (custom radix-91 or base-2048 where allowed).

    Recommended Approach
        - Internal Representation: use schema-aware serialization (Protocol Buffers or Cap'n Proto) for module boundaries to keep graphs compact and enforce type safety.
        - Transport Layer: compress serialized payload with domain-tuned Zstandard, then emit as Ascii85/Base91 stream before passing into ASCII/Unicode symbol pipeline.
        - Hybrid Mode: allow the encoder to switch between direct symbol stream and serialized blob (`{...}`) depending on payload complexity; handshake advertises support via `|s1`.

    Savings Potential
        - Structured prompts with large repeated fields benefit most: internal serialization + compression can reduce pre-token size by 40–60% before ASCII mapping, pushing total savings toward 94–96%.
        - For terse, instruction-style prompts, serialization overhead may outweigh benefits; heuristics should detect when raw symbol encoding is cheaper.

    Implementation Notes
        - Serializer schemas live beside module contracts; version them to avoid decoding drift.
        - Include length prefixes and checksums pre-encoding to detect truncation before ASCII layer.
        - Provide debugging utilities to render serialized blobs back into human-readable form for audits.

</serialization>
<comparison>

    Token Savings vs Standard Prompting
        - Baseline natural-language prompts: 0% savings; full token cost borne by LLM.
        - ASCII core with dynamic packs: typical 80–85% reduction once packs warm up; low-overhead maintenance.
        - Unicode overlay (when tokenizer isolates glyphs): 85–93% savings; higher setup cost but richer expressivity per symbol.
        - Serialization + compression hybrid: 94–96% savings on structured, repetitive payloads; marginal gain on terse commands.

    Tradeoffs & Considerations
        - Implementation Complexity: requires distiller, pack management, and handshake orchestration; standard prompting is plug-and-play.
        - Latency: preprocessing, serialization, and decompression add milliseconds; savings depend on whether LLM latency dominates.
        - Debuggability: compressed streams demand tooling and audit trails; standard prompts are readable by default.
        - Interoperability: both endpoints must share protocol version, tokenizer fingerprint, and packs; mismatches fall back to ASCII baseline.
        - Maintenance: dictionaries and heuristics need continuous tuning; standard prompting shifts burden to prompt engineers instead.

    When to Prefer Each
        - Use compressed protocol for high-volume, repeatable workflows where token cost is material and endpoints can be tightly integrated.
        - Retain standard prompting for ad-hoc, human-authored instructions or when infrastructure cannot guarantee protocol compliance.

</comparison>
<examples>

    Example Prompt Exchange
        - `~1F|med ^+01 +01[d1|diag|pneumonia][d2|med|azithro] :{d2}`
        - Decodes to: "Start session, medical domain; confirm; load pack 01; store diagnosis/context; return JSON describing azithromycin plan."
        - 32 ASCII chars replace ~192 GPT-4 tokens (≈83% savings).

    Error Recovery
        - `>01` requests retransmit of pack 01.
        - `?4C` conveys checksum for previous payload; mismatch forces resend.

</examples>
<open_points>
